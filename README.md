# Predicting Fight Outcomes in MMA using Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning to historical MMA data to predict the outcomes of fights based on fighter statistics. It is built using Python, Jupyter notebooks, and scikit-learn.

## Project Goals
- Collect and clean fight data
- Engineer features like strike differential and win streak
- Train classification models to predict winners
- Evaluate and discuss model accuracy

## Tools and Libraries
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib / seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Data Sources
- [UFC Stats](http://ufcstats.com)
- [Kaggle UFC Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajeevw/ufcdata)
